# vertex-cover
A python script that will produce three vertex covers using different algorithms given a graph in a specific format created for a school project.

The script uses two greedy algorithms to approximate the smallest vertex cover and a brute force algorithm to find the ideal vertex cover.

A **Vertex Cover** is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is connected to one of the vertices in the graph.
